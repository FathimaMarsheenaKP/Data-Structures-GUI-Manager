# Data Structures Visualization

This Java-based project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize and interact with several fundamental data structures, including arrays, stacks, queues (both linear and circular), singly linked lists, and doubly linked lists. The goal is to help users understand and manipulate these data structures interactively, making it easier for learners and practitioners to grasp key concepts of data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures Implemented:

### 1. **Array**
- **Operations**: 
  - **Create**: Initialize an array with a predefined size.
  - **Insert at Position**: Insert an element at any given position within the array.
  - **Delete at Position**: Remove an element from any specific position.
  - **Display**: Display the elements of the array.

### 2. **Stack**
- **Operations**: 
  - **Create**: Initialize an empty stack.
  - **Push**: Insert an element at the top of the stack.
  - **Pop**: Remove and return the element from the top of the stack.
  - **Get at Position**: Retrieve an element at any specific position in the stack.
  - **Display**: Show all elements in the stack.

### 3. **Queue**
- **Operations**: 
  - **Create**: Initialize an empty queue.
  - **Enqueue**: Add an element to the end of the queue.
  - **Dequeue**: Remove and return the element at the front of the queue.
  - **Get**: Retrieve an element from a specific position in the queue.
  - **Display**: Show all elements in the queue.

### 4. **Circular Queue**
- **Operations**: 
  - **Create**: Initialize a circular queue with a predefined size.
  - **Enqueue**: Insert an element into the circular queue.
  - **Dequeue**: Remove and return an element from the front of the circular queue.
  - **Peek**: View the element at the front without removing it.
  - **Display**: Display the elements of the circular queue.

### 5. **Singly Linked List**
- **Operations**: 
  - **Insert at Front**: Insert a new node at the beginning of the list.
  - **Insert at Rear**: Insert a new node at the end of the list.
  - **Delete at Front**: Remove the node from the beginning of the list.
  - **Delete at Rear**: Remove the node from the end of the list.
  - **Display**: Display all elements in the linked list.
  - **Reverse**: Reverse the order of elements in the linked list.

### 6. **Doubly Linked List**
- **Operations**: 
  - **Insert at Front**: Insert a new node at the beginning of the list.
  - **Insert at Rear**: Insert a new node at the end of the list.
  - **Delete at Front**: Remove the node from the beginning of the list.
  - **Delete at Rear**: Remove the node from the end of the list.
  - **Display Forward**: Display all elements in the list from front to rear.
  - **Display Reverse**: Display all elements in the list from rear to front.

## Features
- **Interactive GUI**: The project uses Java Swing for creating a GUI that allows users to perform operations easily.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Users can view the changes in the data structures in real time as they perform insertions, deletions, and other operations.
- **Support for Various Operations**: The program supports a wide range of operations on each data structure, making it a versatile learning tool for students and developers.
- **Error Handling**: The application provides user-friendly messages for invalid operations, such as trying to access or delete from an empty data structure.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The core language used to implement the data structures and GUI.
- **Java Swing**: Used for the graphical user interface to interact with data structures.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FathimaMarsheenaKP/Data-Structures-Visualization.git

## Setup the Project

1. **Open the project in an IDE**:
   - You can use IDEs like **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Eclipse**, or **NetBeans**.
   
2. **Ensure Java JDK is installed**:
   - Make sure that **Java JDK 8 or above** is installed on your system.

## Run the Project

1. **Run the application**:
   - Once the project is set up, run the `Main.java` class to launch the application.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with various data structures using the provided buttons and input fields. For example:

- **For Arrays**: You can create an array, insert or delete elements at specific positions, and display the entire array.
  
- **For Stacks and Queues**: You can push or pop elements, enqueue or dequeue, and see the results immediately in the display field.

- **For Linked Lists**: You can insert or delete nodes at the front or rear, reverse the list, and display the list in forward or reverse order.

## Example Operations

- **Array**: Create an array with 5 elements, insert at position 2, display the array.
  
- **Stack**: Push elements onto the stack, pop an element, display the stack.
  
- **Queue**: Enqueue elements, dequeue an element, and display the queue.

- **Circular Queue**: Enqueue elements, dequeue, peek, and display.

- **Singly Linked List**: Insert at front, delete from rear, reverse the list.

- **Doubly Linked List**: Insert at front, display forward and reverse.

## Conclusion

This project serves as an educational tool for visualizing and interacting with common data structures. It helps in understanding how these structures work through practical operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal. You can experiment with different data structures and their operations to get a deeper insight into their real-world applications.
